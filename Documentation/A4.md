# CodeAssist Review ‚Äì Word Search Assignment

## üìà Insights
- The main algorithmic flaw is in the grid search bounds ‚Äì you‚Äôre only checking positions in `range(n-1)` instead of `range(n)`, which skips the entire last row and column where words could start.
- Your `directions` list is missing two diagonal directions (`down-left` and `up-right`), so words along those diagonals will never be found.
- The nested loop structure and direction-based search approach is sound ‚Äì it just needs the bounds and direction fixes to work correctly.
- Edge-case handling for out-of-bounds checks during word matching looks good, but it can‚Äôt compensate for not starting the search in valid positions.

## üìù Annotations

| Pattern (from code)                  | Suggested Comment |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `for r in range(n - 1):`             | This excludes the last row from search starting positions. Use `range(n)` to check all possible starting positions including the last row. |
| `for c in range(n - 1):`             | This excludes the last column from search starting positions. Use `range(n)` to check all possible starting positions including the last column. |
| `(1, 1),    # down-right`            | You‚Äôre missing two diagonal directions: `(1, -1)` for down-left and `(-1, 1)` for up-right. Add these to check all 8 possible directions. |
| `return (r + 1, c + 1)`              | Good conversion to 1-based indexing for output format as required by the problem specification. |

## ‚úÖ Notes
This review focuses on **algorithmic correctness**.  
Most issues are about **search bounds** and **direction completeness**, not style or formatting.
