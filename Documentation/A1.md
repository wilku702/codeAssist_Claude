# CodeAssist Review ‚Äì Calculator Assignment

## üìà Insights
- The file submission error indicates a **packaging or deployment** issue rather than a code logic problem.
- The calculator implementation uses a **solid Shunting Yard algorithm** for parsing infix expressions into RPN.
- **Error handling in the lexer** has a formatting bug that could hide diagnostic information from users.
- The algorithm correctly handles **operator precedence, parentheses, and negative numbers** through proper tokenization.
- **Question:** Is the issue with how the `calculator.py` file is being packaged or submitted to the autograder system?

## üìù Annotations

| Pattern (from code)                               | Suggested Comment |
|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `raise CalculatorException("Unknown character".format(string[i]))` | The error message format string is missing a placeholder. Use `"Unknown character: {0}".format(string[i])` to display which character caused the error. |
| `precedence <= self.PRECEDENCES[operator_stack[-1]]` | Good implementation of **operator precedence comparison** in the Shunting Yard algorithm. This correctly handles left-associative operators. |
| `val = op2 - op1` | Correct operand order for subtraction in RPN evaluation ‚Äì `op2` is the left operand and `op1` is the right operand from the original infix expression. |
| `DIGIT = re.compile('\\-?\\d+')` | Smart regex pattern that handles **negative numbers** during tokenization, which simplifies parsing compared to treating minus as both unary and binary operator. |

## ‚úÖ Notes
- Most issues are **packaging-related**, not with the algorithm itself.  
- The parsing and evaluation logic is largely correct and well-structured.
